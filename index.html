				<details>
					<summary class="eight">Python</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>I've <a href="#uom-python">earned a certificate in Python</a> in early 2017 and it is my primary language.</p>
						<p>During my time as a <a href="#vrmc">Programming Head</a>, I crafted a <em>lesson plan</em> and <em>taught Python</em> to other clubmembers. I also participated in the <em><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Olympiad for Informatics">NOI</abbr></em>.</p>
						<p>During my time as a Data Analytics Specialist, I was involved in maintaining and <a href="#dro">developing an optimisation model</a> based in Python. I also utilised Python for my other Data Science tasks.</p>
						<p>During my free time, I started numerous <a href="#projects">Data Science projects</a> as well as <em>reusable packages</em> to assist in that process.</p>

						<h3 id="python-ds">DATA SCIENCE</h3>

						<!-- <p>I served my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> in the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Data Science and Artificial Intelligence">DSAI</abbr> branch of my department. As a result, I was involved in many Data Science projects, gaining much exposure to <em>real-life applications</em> of the field as well as making <em>tangible contributions</em> to society.</p>
						<p>I've played critical roles in many steps of the Data Science process: <a href="#mining">mining</a>, <a href="#scraping">scraping</a>, <a href="#cleaning">cleaning</a>, <a href="#modelling">modelling</a>, <a href="#visualisation">visualisation</a> and <a href="#analytics">analytics</a>. Owing to my 2 years of meaningful experiences, I've become <em>multidisciplinary</em> in this aspect.</p>
						<p>Below are some of the Data Science packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="nine">PANDAS</div>
						<!-- <p>I use Pandas for almost all my Data Science projects. This versatile tool handles and <em>manipulates dataframes</em> very well, and can also be used for <em>visualisation</em>. Coupled with Jupyter, data becomes much more visual, and as such the developmental process is accelerated.</p> -->

						<div class="eight">GEOPANDAS</div>
						<!-- <p>Geopandas specialises in <em>manipulating shapefiles</em> and geometries. Owing to its compatibility with other packages such as Seaborn, Shapely and Geoplot, I use it for many of my <a href="#geospatial-projects">Geospatial projects</a>.</p> -->

						<div class="seven">MATPLOTLIB</div>
						<!-- <p>Matplotlib is Python's main visualisation tool. With the addition of packages such as Seaborn, beautiful visualisations can be produced.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I mainly used Matplotlib during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> times, <em>creating detailed charts</em> to assist senior management in making decisions.</p> -->

						<div class="six">SEABORN</div>
						<!-- <p>Seaborn offers a wider variety of visualisation functions and stylings. Although I have produced quite alot of <em>interesting charts</em>, I feel that the package still has much to offer. One of my favourites to use.</p> -->

						<div class="five">GEOPLOT</div>
						<!-- <p>Geoplot interacts mainly with Geopandas to produce beautiful plots of the Earth's surface. Coupled with the Contextily package, the geometric plots can even be overlaid onto the world map. I definitely had some fun with this package, and it has helped me identify problems and anomalies in data MUCH more easily.</p> -->

						<div class="five">NUMPY</div>
						<!-- <p>Numpy is a versatile Python package used for complex mathematical operations. But apart from the <em>games</em> I've created when starting out with Python, I haven't built any large-scale projects centred around Numpy. Rather, Numpy is interweaved into my various projects, using only one or two Numpy functions on a regular basis.</p> -->

						<div class="four">TENSORFLOW</div>
						<!-- <p>I have earned a certificate in Tensorflow in the past. And I have followed some tutorials online. I have also produced an <em><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Recurrent Neural Network">RNN</abbr> model</em> for music creation. However, I don't feel the same satisfaction creating Tensorflow models as I do with other projects. As such, I don't put much effort into it.</p> -->

						<div class="two">SCIPY</div>
						<!-- <p>I have dealt with snippets of Scipy in learning other packages, but never specifically Scipy.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-web-scraping">WEBSCRAPING</h3>

						<!-- <p>Web Scraping involves programmatically scouring the internet for segments of information and it tends to be my first step towards any project. It ties in very well into my passions and interests:</p> -->
						<!-- <p>1. For geography, I have used Web Scraping to extract information pertaining to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQIXKejfbHe2FuPKp0qvdS6OfLDceHGO2WvxGgJtyuoD6HyAmd9Qxj8NZsJA4JItvPcqRKyMJUdDVF-/pubhtml?gid=2090887247&single=true" class="ext">malls</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQIXKejfbHe2FuPKp0qvdS6OfLDceHGO2WvxGgJtyuoD6HyAmd9Qxj8NZsJA4JItvPcqRKyMJUdDVF-/pubhtml?gid=196836479&single=true" class="ext">MRT stations</a>, cities, schools, community centres, neighbourhood police posts, fire stations and many more.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>2. For languages, I have utilised the search functions of various dictionary websites to produce multiple <a href="#language-projects">functions that output definitions and sample sentences</a>. I also use it to <em>extract new words from news links and articles</em>, sending them to my Google Sheets for storage.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>3. For coding, I have produced countless scripts to <em>extract coding tips and documentation</em> from coding websites such as W3schools. All tips and documentation has been neatly compiled into my Google Sheets as well.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>4. For music, I have developed a versatile <a href="#music-projects">function that converts song titles into chords</a>. The chords are then <em>harmonised into databases</em> once again. I even created an <em><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Recurrent Neural Network">RNN</abbr> model</em> based on this.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Below are some of the Web Scraping packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="nine">BEAUTIFUL SOUP</div>
						<!-- <p>Beautiful Soup is involved in <em>parsing</em> and <em>extracting</em> vital information from the HTML format.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I have used Beautiful Soup for 4 years now and my first project involved <em>searching for news articles containing specific keywords</em>. I have come a long way since then, producing <a href="#spiderman">various packages</a> for convenient and repeated use.</p> -->

						<div class="six">REQUESTS</div>
						<!-- <p>This package goes hand in hand with Beautiful Soup I had to learn this as well.</p> -->

						<div class="four">SELENIUM</div>
						<!-- <p>Selenium is involved in replicating a user's interactions with a website. It can perform more UI-centric operations as compared to Beautiful Soup.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I did manage to create some <em>YouTube and Google scrapers</em> in the past, but due to some versioning issues pertaining to Chromedriver, those scripts no longer work. It is a headache to try to fix the issues.</p> -->

						<div class="three">SCRAPY</div>
						<!-- <p>Scrapy deals with hopping from site to site. However, I discovered it too late, for I have already created a BeautifulSoup package that does just that.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-data-cleaning">DATA CLEANING</h3>

						<!-- <p>For most of my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> journey, I had to deal with very messy data. Types of messy data included:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Raw text with spelling errors</li>
							<li>Embedded datetimes of various formats</li>
							<li>Poorly formatted source files</li>
							<li>Inconsistent choice of keywords</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In order to complete the given Data Science tasks, alot of cleaning had to be done. As such, I turned to a couple of useful tools to assist me in this.</p>
						<p>Below are some of the Data Cleaning packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="seven">REGEX</div>
						<!-- <p><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Regular Expressions">Regex</abbr> deals with finding and extracting specific patterns in strings. I am pretty good at <em>pattern recognition</em> so I can safely say I'm quite good at extracting these kinds of embedded data. Although there are other specialised tools out there such as <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Natural Language ToolKit">NLTK</abbr> and Gensim that deal with <em>text analytics</em>, Regex is more that sufficient for basic janitorial duties.</p> -->

						<div class="seven">DATETIME</div>
						<!-- <p>Datetime deals with converting raw strings to and from useful datetime formats. It is vital in dealing with <em>trend analysis</em> and <em>partitioning</em>, which is why I use it often, along with the subsidiary Time package.</p> -->

						<div class="five">JSON</div>
						<!-- <p>The Json package deals with Json data, and using a combination of tricks, I've always managed to get the right Json data out. It is my go-to data structure to use beyond dataframes.</p> -->

						<div class="five">COLLECTIONS</div>
						<!-- <p>Collections deals with sets of objects, finding useful aggregates such as counts and uniques. Not a universally used tool, but still useful for <em>aggregation</em>, <em>debugging</em> and producing <em>quick insights</em>.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-app-dev">APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h3>

						<!-- <p>I have contributed greatly towards the <a href="#dro">DRO project</a>, a software that <em>simulated</em> and <em>optimised ambulance performance</em>. I have <em>proposed new data structures</em> and <em>software architectures</em> and managed to <em>reduce time and space complexity</em> in various portions of the code. The project definitely instilled in me many pragmatic programming principles, since I am learning all these lessons the hard way.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Aside from that, I have produced several packages centred around Telepot (Telegram's Python SDK) that allow me to <em>monitor and operate my code from Telegram</em> itself.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Below are some of the App Development packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="six">GSHEETS</div>
						<!-- <p>This serves as my Python interface with Google Sheets. I have created quite a few <em>functions that allow me to retrieve from and update my database</em>. These have helped me maintain my datasets, making the process <em>semi-automatic</em>.</p> -->

						<div class="six">TELEPOT</div>
						<!-- <p>This is what I use to connect to my Telegram Bots from Python. Although most of my Telegram projects lie in Google Cloud, I have created packages that allow me to <em>monitor and execute my code from Telegram</em> itself. This includes a <em>progress tracker</em> (that says how many loop iterations have been completed), and a <em>time estimator</em> (that estimates the time taken for the code to complete).</p> -->

						<div class="four">SQLALCHEMY</div>
						<!-- <p>SQL Alchemy is a package that allows you to connect with an SQL Server. I have gone through alot of practice exercises and even implemented an <em>SQL database</em> for myself. However, I want my data to be available wherever I am, and as such I have transitioned into Google Sheets.</p> -->

						<div class="three">FLASK</div>
						<!-- <p>Flask is a Python framework for application development. I have intially wanted to create my notes using Flask and SQL, but I prefer convenience more than anything. So, despite delving quite deep into the Flask tutorials, I haven't followed through with my plan.</p> -->

						<div class="one">DJANGO</div>
						<!-- <p>Django is also a Python framework for application development. Same as Flask, my initial plan was to create my note taking software locally. I didn't follow through with this plan despite my exploration of the package.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-language">NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</h3>

						<!-- <p>One of my greatest passions is studying languages. As such, I have picked up quite a handful language-specific packages, and experimented with even more than what's listed below.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Below are some of the Language packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="seven">CHINESE</div>
						<!-- <p>The Chinese package deals with processing chinese text. It is capable of tokenisation, which is something that's hard to code for. It also can provide definitions and pinyin.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I have used this package to <a href="#language-projects">parse long chunks of chinese articles and song lyrics</a>, and harmonised them into my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTRazujPmu4-uVX0VZmNqLOqbnO2hyBrmGs2Ogmuqa4B2XhEh9HhhQzQHIrMxZOaOUGi7o8ak7alau4/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true" class="ext">database</a>. I have also used this to create a web-based <em>function that searches for sample sentences</em>.</p> -->

						<div class="six">HANZICONV</div>
						<!-- <p>Hanziconv is simple. It just converts simplified chinese characters to and from their traditional form. Even though it is a small package, it is fast and reliable. And according to my ranking system, I have put it at skill level 6.</p> -->

						<div class="five"><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Natural Language ToolKit">NLTK</abbr></div>
						<!-- <p>This package deals with <em>tokenising</em>, <em>sentiment analysis</em>, <em>topic segmentation</em> and <em>part-of-speech tagging</em>.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>I have a few experiences with this package. Initially, during my first week at <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr>, I was tasked to explore the utility of such a package in text analytics. However, at the time, I was quite unfamiliar with Data Science and its applications so I didn't go much into it.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>During the later part of my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>, I was reintroduced to this package. And with my newfound knowledge, I was able to utilise it better. It was my original intention to use it to <em>classify my notes</em>. However, due to my discovering of the Datamuse <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, I leaned towards that instead, since it was an <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and could be easily used on Google Cloud.</p> -->

						<div class="five">PYKAKASI</div>
						<!-- <p>Pykakasi is a Natural Language Processing package that transliterates Japanese into Romaji (Romanised spelling). Similaarly to Chinese, I've used this very closely with my web scraping functions to produce a <a href="#language-projects">sentence searcher</a>.</p> -->

						<div class="five">TRANSLATE</div>
						<!-- <p>Translate is the Swiss-army knife for language translation. It can detect the source language and translate any language found on Google Translate. However, I think I overused it and now I am blocked unfortunately. Luckily, I have my other packages to assist me in this.</p> -->

						<div class="five">HANGUL ROMANIZE</div>
						<!-- <p>Hangul Romanize works with the Korean language. I have incorporated this into my <a href="#language-projects">sentence searchers</a> as well.</p> -->

						<div class="three">GENSIM</div>
						<!-- <p>Gensim is similar to NLTK, but it focusses on <em>topic modelling</em> and <em>semantic extraction</em>. And similarly to NLTK, I have experimented on it to produce my classification scripts. But after discovering the Datamuse <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, I used it instead.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-math">MATH</h3>

						<!-- <p>I also have a passion for mathematics and although I mainly do my math adventures on Desmos, I have done a couple of Perlin Noise experiments on Python.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>Below are some of the Math packages I've used.</p> -->

						<div class="seven">SHAPELY</div>
						<!-- <p>The Shapely package deals with geometries and lines. It is the key component of Geopandas and subsequently Geoplot and it has helped me with many of my Data Science Projects.</p> -->

						<div class="six">MATH</div>
						<!-- <p>The Math package is quite useful for my geospatial adventures. Besides having useful functions to calculate distance between 2 points, it also interacts well with Shapely to produce more intricate shapes.</p> -->

						<div class="six">RANDOM</div>
						<!-- <p>The Random package mainly serves one purpose: to output a randomly generated number. But in that regard, it becomes one of the most useful for the purpose of creating noise.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>For example, for the <a href="#dro">DRO project</a>, I had to upscale 2018's data for 2020 to 2030. A mere random selection of data points to duplicate was dubious, and so I needed to expertly come up with layers of <em>random noise</em> so that the dataset is as realistic as possible. With Random being a simple package to use, I could implement my ideas easily.</p> -->

						<div class="four">ITERTOOLS</div>
						<!-- <p>I use itertools mainly for its ability to output all combinations of a list, and all combinations between two lists. It is very useful for <em>data manipulation</em> and <em>aggregation</em>.</p> -->

						<div class="three">GRAPH TOOL</div>
						<!-- <p>Graph Tool is a package linked to graph theory. Before I had discovered this package, I had a <em>script that scoured Wikipedia and come up with loads of relational data regarding the urls</em>. However, I stored them in Json formats. One of the projects I had in mind was to incorporate this Graph Tool to <em>create a "Relatedness" map of wikipedia</em>.</p> -->

						<div class="two">ANYTREE</div>
						<!-- <p>Anytree deals with tree logic. Although I have tried a couple of sample practices, I haven't found something practical to do with it. And as such, my interest in it dropped.</p> -->

						<h3 id="python-others">OTHERS</h3>

						<!-- <p>These are the other packages I have experimented with during my coding adventures.</p> -->

						<div class="six">PYCHORD</div>
						<!-- <p>Pychord deals with chords and their components. I heavily used it to <a href="#music-projects">harmonise and compile my music data</a>.</p> -->

						<div class="five"><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Python Imaging Library">PIL</abbr></div>
						<!-- <p><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Python Imaging Library">PIL</abbr> is used for manipulating images. Mainly, it is used in Machine Learning to reduce number of features in order to train recognition models. However, I use it to design cards for my <a href="#malls">MALLS card game</a>, as well as post-process my math art.</p> -->

						<div class="three">LIBROSA</div>
						<!-- <p>I tried to create a chord analyser that takes in an mp3 and outputs the chords it uses. The primary tool I used to develop it is Librosa, which deals with <em>audio processing and analysis</em>. However, there were quite a few setbacks when creating the package, particularly because my initial plan to extract youtube videos for mp3 files was slow and unsustainable.</p> -->

						<div class="three">SCHEDULE</div>
						<!-- <p>With Schedule, you can set when a certain code is run. However, besides the long codes that had to be run for my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>, I find not much use in it for my purposes.</p> -->
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="seven">R</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>R is a language for statistical computing and graphics. And it's fast in manipulating data. I have undergone a <a href="#harvard-ds">Data Science course</a> taught in R, picking up quite a few standard libraries. For my Capstone project, I created a model that predicted how much I would like a particular song, based on my iTunes data that I have carefully compiled.</p>
						<p>The other time I used R was during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>. In my vocation, I learnt to <em>operate and maintain R scripts</em> meant for <em>cleaning data</em>. Also, I was tasked to internalise the inner workings of certain codes and <em>translate them from R to Python</em>. That is my most memorable usage of R.</p>
						<p>But other than that, I've made a couple of independent <em>visualisations</em> and <em>small projects</em> and that's pretty much it.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="seven">Google Apps Script</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>Google Apps Script allows me to create Web Applications as well as perform other functions on the Google Cloud Platform.</p>
						<p>Following a couple of tutorials, I started creating my own <a href="#telegram">Telegram bots</a>. Based in Google Apps Script, I can either let the Telegram bot <em>send occasional messages to me</em>, or <em>accept inputs to either add or retrieve data from my database</em> (Google Sheets).</p>
						<p>I also enable my code to <em>send me bug-report emails</em>, as well as regularly <em>accept data from <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and sites</em>.</p>
						<p>Since Google Apps Script is based in JavaScript anyway, I can simultaneously learn the JavaScript syntax. I see this as an absolute win!</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="seven">HTML</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>I have had a long history of HTML but it is only recently that I get back to it. In particular, apart from <em>designing this website from scratch</em>, I <em>designed a Data Governance Portal</em> for <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Ministry Of Manpower">MOM</abbr>. So that's quite useful for the organisation I guess.</p>
						<p>I also designed my <a href="#malls">card game</a> using HTML and CSS.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="seven">CSS</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>The older designs of my website used to contain alot of JavaScript because I was confident that my <em>animations</em> and <em>site functionalities</em> were good. However, they tended to fail alot on other browsers and were atrociously slow on phone. As such, I had to migrate everything to CSS, as a more elegant solution to what I tried to achieve.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="three">SQL</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>SQL deals with the loading and unloading of data from databases. Although I did practice a bit using SQLAlchemy, I only truly started writing SQL scripts when creating Power BI dashboards and SSIS packages. It's not a fun language to debug.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="three">Ruby</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p><em>Ruby on Rails</em> is another database structure, and I primarily saw it during the <a href="#dro">DRO project</a>. Occasionally, when the software failed, I had to go deep into the code and change one or two things. While doing so, I have learnt to read and understand Ruby code. I even bought a Ruby on Rails book to understand it.</p>
						<p>But I took one step further. Making a copy of the code, I managed to <em>reverse engineer</em> it, making minor edits to let me see what's happening behind the scenes. Though I didn't go much into it, it was still an interesting experience.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="three">C++</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>C++ was one of the first languages I learnt, even before Python. Following the contents of a book, as well as online resources, I managed to get my C++ to a readable level. Even though I managed to make a couple of <em>simple games and functions</em>, I haven't practised C++ enough to raise my skill level to 4.</p>
						<p>On a side note, I've also learnt <em>RobotC</em> in the past, in preparation for the VEX Robotics competition, but I don't practice that anymore. Learnt a bit of <em>Arduino</em> as well.</p>

				</details>
				<details>
					<summary class="three">JavaScript</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>Apart from learning JavaScript via Google Apps Script, I also utilised it heavily during the early stages of developing this website. I also referred to my JavaScript book often, making notes along the way.</p>

					<summary class="one">Java</summary>
					<div class="history">

						<p>My Chinese learning journey began during the second year of <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Junior College">JC</abbr>. At first I was learning from Duolingo, but ever since I finished that course, I began to challenge myself more. I began to aim big, aim for standardised test. From spending hours revising, to <em>analysing news articles</em>, I have been treating my studies a little too intensely (I could spend 30 hours studying and not feel tired).</p>
						<p>And so in September 2019, I took and <a href="#hsk3">passed the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="汉语水平考试, Chinese Proficiency Test">HSK</abbr> 3 test</a>. And in March 2021, I took and <a href="#hsk5">passed the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="汉语水平考试, Chinese Proficiency Test">HSK</abbr> 5 test</a>. But I want to achieve more. I want to achieve the highest level. But seeing as though the standards are going to be revamped, that won't happen for a long time.</p>

						<p>French was the first foreign language that I learnt (in 2015). After <em>finishing the Duolingo course</em> in 2019, I began taking my French more seriously, buying grammar textbooks and storybooks. I also downloaded the HelloTalk app, which allowed me to <em>interact with native French speakers</em>, which definitely helped my French quite a bit</p>

						<p>The spark for learning Japanese only came when Netflix introduced Anime onto its platform. After just watching a few episodes, I became invested in its grammar and its efficiency. As such, in 2020, I started learning Japanese. Unfortunately, I have nothing to show for my current ability. I'm working towards the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Japanese Language Proficiency Test">JLPT</abbr> N4 test, but as long as I can't get a booking done, I can't accomplish my goals in this language.

						<p>Similar to Japanese, I started learning Korean only when I got properly introduced to the culture. From K-pop to K-drama to Korea itself, I got interested in the culture. I even signed up for a <em>Korean language class at Sejong</em>, before deciding that it's best for me to just self-study using other online resources.  I am working towards the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Test Of Proficiency In Korean">TOPIK</abbr> 1 test and plan to get into the second tier.

						<p>Musescore is a music notation software that allows users to create <a href="#music">music sheets and arrangements</a>. I started using it in 2019, creating arrangements of old popular songs like "What I've Done" and "Rewrite the Stars".

This had caused my co-workers and I to <em>find new solutions and workarounds</em> to ensure that work is not completely halted.</p>
						<p>But besides that, all I have are good experiences in APIs. They have been a tremendous help in my data extraction and data science projects. For example:</p>
						<p>Datamuse - a powerful word-finding engine</p>
						<p>Google Search - a handy way to use Google's search engine</p>
						<p>YouTube Data - allows users to manage their YouTube accounts</p>

						<p>For creating my personal notes on subjects, I very much prefer to make my own Telegram Bots from scratch rather than use traditional apps. Reason being, I'd like more control about how I learn, and add some personal flair to the functionality of the app. Also, since all my notes are found on the same Telegram platform, it is more convenient.

						<p>Tableau is one of the leading data visualisation tools. I was introduced to it in mid 2019, when I attended the <em>Tableau Day Out event</em> at Marina Bay Sands. Getting to know the functionality, and various projects possible with Tableau. All that. But then I got the opportunity to <em>perform a <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="User Acceptance Test">UAT</abbr> based in Tableau</em> and I find it quite nice to use.</p>
						<p>Then came 2020, when Tableau was installed on my work machines. I played around with it for around a month, following tutorials and <em>making my own dashboards</em> using data I had on hand. But then, my juniors came and I was sucked into other tasks. Nevertheless, I was still a <em>reliable mentor</em> to the person who actually ended up using it. I <em>provided feedback</em>, came up with suggestions and <em>worked out some dashboard logic</em> with him. Furthermore, I <em>guided him in creating the dashboard</em> for the <a href="#scdf">DECAMS project</a>, often having to alter my code because of his findings.</p>
						<p>I was also part of the committee that <em>judged <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Singapore Civil Defence Force">SCDF</abbr> submissions into the Data Arcade Tournament 2020</em>, a government-wide competition revolving around storytelling using Tableau. Using our knowledge on Tableau, we managed to <em>come up with ranking criteria</em> for the submissions for final judgement by senior officers.</p>

There were MANY complications regarding the use of this API, for Google started charging for its usage some time in 2019. I had to familiarise myself with the Cloud Platform, <em>setting limits</em> and <em>managing keys</em>, all to ensure that the codes continued to work.</p>
						<p>The second was during my adventures in <em>Web Applications</em> and Telegram Bots. As mentioned in other sections, I host my Telegram Bots on the Google Cloud, with Google Sheets serving as my database. Google Cloud helps me monitor my usages and execution errors so I'm grateful for that. I've also produced one non-Telegram Web Application so there's that.</p>

					<summary class="nine">Data Science</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>I served my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> in the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Data Science and Artificial Intelligence">DSAI</abbr> branch of my department. As a result, I was involved in many Data Science projects, gaining much <em>exposure to real-life applications</em> of the field as well as making <em>tangible contributions to society</em>.</p>
						<p>I've played critical roles in many steps of the Data Science process: <a href="#mining">mining</a>, <a href="#scraping">scraping</a>, <a href="#cleaning">cleaning</a>, <a href="#modelling">modelling</a>, <a href="#visualisation">visualisation</a> and <a href="#analytics">analytics</a>. Owing to my 2 years of meaningful experiences, I've become <em>multidisciplinary</em> in this aspect.</p>
						<p>Below are some of my skills in data science.</p>

						<h3 id="cleaning">DATA CLEANING</h3>

						<p>Data Cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to <em>identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data</em> and then <em>replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data</em>.</p>
						<p>This was my BIGGEST role during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> years and the number of <em>janitorial tasks</em> I had to do was countless. Data that came in had many problems:</p>
						<p>They often were of widely different formats. I'm okay with the different naming conventions of the JSON/CSV/XLSX files. But the problem lay in the <em>UNSTRUCTURED PDF and TXT files</em>, especially when there were EMPTY FIELDS. Whenever there was an empty field, the copied text would completely ignore the field. Not leave it as empty. COMPLETELY IGNORE. That made extraction very challenging. So the pain was just to <em>use some complicated <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Regular Expressions">Regex</abbr> rules to extract essential data out</em>.</p>
						<p>The excel files were sometimes awkwardly formatted. I don't know what the creators were thinking, but alot of times, the <em>data was weirdly merged</em>, such that nothing aligned with each other at all. What's more, there was an excel file where the data was stored over 3000 sheets, and NOTHING ever started on the same line. So that was also painful.</p>
						<p>I had to deal with alot of RAW TEXT FILES. This came with the whole set of spelling errors and wrong word usage. I don't know how many times I had to <em>come up with <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Regular Expressions">Regex</abbr> logic</em> to <em>harmonise the data</em>.</p>
						<p>Another pain I had to endure was when the data was unlabelled. No clue what the data fields represented and no clue what the possible values were. These were often data sent by external vendors, so I couldn't even send emails to them to ask. But that was just something I had to slowly figure out, by <em>creating some visuals</em>, <em>pivot tables</em> and <em>tree diagrams</em>.</p>
						<p>A very small pain was just to deal with missing data, filling it with either a default value, or an aggregated one. Not so painful, thankfully.</p>

						<h3 id="analytics">DATA ANALYTICS</h3>
						<p>Data Analytics is taking analyzed data and working on it in a meaningful and useful way to make well-versed business decisions. This was my job title for my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>.</p>
						<p>Indeed, this describes my jobscope quite well, as I have played a <em>vital role in Singapore's ambulance performance</em>. Particularly, I have been tasked on numerous occasions to <em>select potential locations for future Fire Bases</em>. This included the <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Neighbourhood Police Post">NPP</abbr>s, Community Centres, public utilities as well as void decks. This was a fun task because I could <em>use my visualisations and reports to make informed decisions</em>. Also, there was loads of fun in exploring Singapore through Google Street View.</p>

						<h3 id="scraping">DATA SCRAPING</h3>

						<p>Data Scraping is the process of <em>importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file</em> saved on your computer.</p>
						<p>This was one of my favourite parts of Data Science, for I got to employ my <em>pattern-recognition</em> skills to the fullest. I've used Data Scraping to <em>extract locations of Community Centres and <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Neighbourhood Police Post">NPP</abbr>s</em>, in order to <em>propose new locations for ambulance placement</em>.</p>

						<h3 id="visualisation">DATA VISUALISATION</h3>

						<p>Data Visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and <em>understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data</em>.</p>
						<p>This was also an integral part of the data science process. Besides being used for data science reports, I used them for <em>decision-making</em>. Using various Geospatial visualisation tools, I was able to <em>spot gaps in ambulance coverage</em>, allowing me to choose a location best suited to host ambulances.</p>
						<p>Quite a fun process overall.</p>

						<h3 id="modelling">MATHEMATICAL MODELLING</h3>

						<p>Mathematical Modelling is the development of a mathematical model, which in turn is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. Again, I used it heavily during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>.</p>
						<p>My main use for mathematical modelling is to understand the data better, drafting some theories as to why the data and trends are as such. Coming from a triple mathematics background, I have an excess of mathematical concepts laying dormant in my brain. As such, I tried to apply them as much as possible. For example, I have used the <em>Chi Square test</em> on numerous occasions to quickly find relations between fields. Also, I've used various <em>Numerical Methods techniques to find approximations</em> for some complex equations.</p>

						<h3 id="mining">DATA MINING</h3>

						<p>Data Mining is a process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.</p>
						<p>For alot of projects during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr> years, I served as the frontline of the Data Science process, as I was the one to do up a preliminary investigation of the data, as well as <em>come up with some useful metrics</em>. For example, I <em>did up the initial report</em> for the following projects:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Finding fraudulent transactions</em> within the Finance Department</li>
							<li><em>Designing an Inventory Management System</em> for the Logistics Department</li>
							<li><em>Designing an <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Individual Physical Proficiency Test">IPPT</abbr> dashboard</em> to track the passing rates and investigate why the passing rates were low.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE</h3>

						<p>Business Intelligence leverages software and services to transform data into actionable insights that inform an organization’s strategic and tactical business decisions.</p>
						<p>Similar to Data Analytics, I have <em>used my visualisations and reports to better understand why the data is as such</em>. For example, during my <a href="#scdf">DECAMS project</a>, I was tasked to <em>find out the possible reasons why Fire Alarms gave out False Alarms</em>. This was a month-long project but I think the insights the team provided were sufficient, albeit trivial.</p>

						<h3>MACHINE LEARNING</h3>

						<p>In terms of courses, I've done 2:</p>
						<p><a href="#harvard-ds">HarvardX Data Science</a> - a course teaching Machine Learning based in R programming language</p>
						<p><a href="#tensorflow">IBM Deep Learning with Tensorflow</a> - a course teaching Tensorflow based in Python</p>
						<p>But of course, I've done quite a lot of independent projects as well. Specifically, I have also <em>created an <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Recurrent Neural Network">RNN</abbr> model</em> for music creation and a couple of <em>recommender engines</em>.</p>

						<h3>DATABASE MANAGEMENT</h3>

						<p>Database Management, allows a person to organize, store and retrieve data from a computer. Database Management can also describe, the data storage, operations and security practices of a Database Administrator (DBA), throughout the life cycle of the data.</p>
						<p>Professionally, I haven't done much in the realm of database management, apart from some <em>training sessions</em> and some <em>guided practice</em>.</p>
						<p>But outside of work, I think my Google Cloud adventures more than makes up for it. From my <em>Python extraction/upload functions</em>, to my <em>dynamically-coded Google Sheets</em> data structures, to my <em>final-frontier Telegram Bots</em>, I'm quite familiar with this.</p>

					<summary class="eight">Mathematics</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>Since young, I've excelled at Maths, achieving the <a href="#best-in-maths">Best in Mathematics"</a> level award in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. I've also won numerous awards during my schooling life, winning a Silver in <a href="#smo"><abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Singapore Mathematical Olympiad">SMO</abbr></a> for 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and many other competitions of varying difficulty. I even took a triple mathematics combination in Junior College.</p>
						<p>But I think the accomplishment I most cherish is my Gold Award for the <a href="#ti">Designing with <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="Texas Instruments">TI</abbr> Graphing Calculators competition in 2018</a>. The competition judged submissions based on their ability to <em>blend Art and Mathematics to fulfil a particular theme</em>. The theme for mine was "Towards a Smart Nation".</p>
						<p>After that, I was set on a path to create math. In 2019, I launched my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mynameizzhafeez/?hl=en" class="ext">Instagram page</a>, a page dedicated to creating art on Desmos Graphing Calculator. The graphs created started off with simple <em>polar and parametric equations</em>, but I quickly <em>developed intense techniques</em> such as <em>3D projection</em> that further enhance the quality of my work. As of now, I've gained 450 followers and <em>actively involve myself in the online math community</em>.</p>
						<p>Here are some of my interests in Math, and some <a href="#desmos">others</a> if interested.</p>

						<h3>GRAPHING</h3>

						<p>I've developed quite alot of graphing techniques over the years and have produced some cool graphs. But I guess that's not a "Technical Skill". I think the skills I picked up were of <em>analysing the behaviours of certain curves and functions</em>. I think I have a good enough intuition to <em>understand how a certain equation will behave</em> near 0 and near infinity for example. Maybe even the difficult differential equations. I can kind of picture them in my head, owing to my Desmos adventures.</p>

						<h3>STATISTICS</h3>

						<p>Apart from the concepts picked up from education, my time as a Data Analytics Specialist has taught me many things in the world of statistics, stochastic processes and big data. And I've got alot of practice in it as well.</p>

						<h3>NUMERICAL ANALYSIS</h3>

						<p>Numerical Analysis is the area of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for solving numerically the problems of continuous mathematics.</p>
						<p>This permeates quite alot of my life. Nothing in particular comes to mind, but the ideas behind it, and the methods under it have definitely seen action in my line of work.</p>

						<h3>CALCULUS</h3>

						<p>This is purely for fun haha. Sometimes when I see an interesting Calculus question, I'll try it. But I think now my solving skills have deteriorated.</p>

					<summary class="seven">Music</summary>
					<div class="history">
						<p>I started learning the <em>piano</em> when I was 5, and managed to obtain <em>Grade 5 for both Theory and Practical</em> by 12. But after that, my hands started to shake and I had to stop.</p>
						<p>But I was never out of music, for I immediately ended up in <em>Choir</em>, in which I was in the First Bass section. I was quite good initially, but started to get worse as my health deteriorated during my senior years of Secondary School. Nevertheless, I still managed to <em>win awards in competitions</em> and concerts before my departure, so that was fun.</p>
						<p>I also learned to <em>play the guitar</em> in 2014, but that was quite short-lived</p>
						<p>But in 2019, I rose back to the music scene, <a href="https://musescore.com/izzhafeez" class="ext">posting my covers and arrangements onto Musescore</a> (a music sharing platform), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpuVmLLEmLWDlCim2dCgoA" class="ext">YouTube</a>. So far, I've gained a combined following of over 1300 and it's still rising. Now, even though I've slowed down in terms of releasing music scores, I have turned to <em>improvising on my piano</em> and <em>creating original compositions</em>.</p>
						<p>Here's what I've done in the music scene.</p>

						<h3>MUSIC THEORY</h3>

						<p>I'm very invested in music theory, and I've <em>researched quite a lot of advanced topics</em> related to it. But indeed, having a good theory foundation does not make me a good musician. Hence, I try to use the concepts I've picked up as much as possible in my creations, but I always feel that there's more to learn and explore.</p>

						<h3>MUSIC TRANSCRIPTION</h3>

						<p>Music Transcription is the practice of notating a piece which was previously unnotated.</p>
						<p>Specifically, I listen to songs and try to produce sheet music. So far, I think I've <em>transcribed more than 100 songs</em>, so I think I have a good enough foundation on it. I can visibly see that the quality of my scores has improved over the years, and they're still improving, as I get more feedback from my partners at <em>Jellynote</em>.</p>
						<p>This remains to be the bulk of my views and popularity.</p>

						<h3>MASHUPS</h3>

						<p>While transcriptions make up the majority of my popular works, I dedicated most of my time to creating Mashups, which are fusions of disparate musical elements and ideas.</p>
						<p>Particularly, I produce mashups of popular songs, such as my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WWADSU9240" class="ext"><abbr tabindex="0" title="National Day Parade">NDP</abbr> medley</a>, meme mashups and chord-progression mashups.</p>
						<p>This is my biggest passion in music, drawing connections between seemingly disparate songs and tunes. Revamping them just by adding a simple undermelody.</p>

						<h3>ORIGINALS</h3>

						<p>This is a fun past-time. Creating original compositions. They're not so good though.</p>

					<div class="history">
						<p>I was chosen for this role by the preceding committee for my prior knowledge of Python. I must admit, I didn't perform my duties that well as a programming head, but I tried my best nonetheless. I learned from my mistakes, of course. What I've done in my position:</p>
						<p>Within a month of attaining my role, I was heavily involved in the <em>VEX Robotics competition</em>. This meant <em>learning a new language (RobotC) within a short period of time</em>, <em>making notes for it</em>, as well as <em>teaching it to the others</em>. It was a painful process, as the Mid-Year Exams were also nearby. There was also the "Autonomous" portion of the competition, in which I tried but failed to produce a working piece of code. But I still had fun nonetheless. It was a good experience, after all.</p>
						<p>In Term 3, I was in charge of <em>preparing a Python course</em> for the other clubmembers. Every time I look back at it, it is with great cringe and disappointment, for I failed in imparting any knowledge whatsoever. I had spent quite a great deal of time preparing proper training material. But ultimately it came down to my lack of ability in explaining the material itself. As a result, I wasted quite alot of time. It is my greatest failure in programming thus far. But I'm glad that during my <abbr tabindex="0" titlex="National Service">NS</abbr>, I was able to hone my communication skills, and provide better explanations for complex topics.</p>
						<p>That was it for the programming-intensive roles, apart from the <em>research sessions during the off-peak periods</em>. Also, the robotics competition that the club helped to facilitate.</p>
						<p>However, my contributions came in once again during the March camp. I <em>came up with 3 of the camp activities</em>, adding in my own puzzles to the camp. As well as a Kahoot quiz at the end. I thought it was quite fun, but idk haha.</p>
